## Looking Back at the Semester
Throughout the course of ICS 314, I have learned concepts that are vital not only in web development but can also be applied to any domain of software engineering. This course taught me how to think like an engineer, revealing the extensive thought and deliberation that goes into every stage of development. Beyond cultivating an engineering mindset, I gained insights into quality control, coding standards, and ethical decision-making, which are skills that will serve me throughout a lifelong career.

## Coding Standards Outside of Web Dev
Coding standards, much like quality control in manufacturing, ensure consistency throughout an application or program. These standards are requirements that your product needs to meet, and in software engineering, this can mean thoroughly commenting code to make it accessible to others, ensuring that function return types are consistent, or precisely specifying the object types that functions accept as parameters. Adhering to coding standards creates a cohesive codebase and allows other developers to quickly understand what each component does. Good coding standards shouldn't be confined to web development alone; they should be the foundation across all coding practices. By following these principles, you create work that is maintainable, scalable, and collaborative, which are all qualities that define professional software engineering.

## Ethical Considerations 
Ethics in software development has emerged as a big issue, especially in today's landscape of powerful tech companies. Many organizations don't follow ethical work practices or exploit user data for profit. You cannot simply clock into work and complete your assigned tasks while believing that you bear no responsibility for the decisions made by leadership or the impact your company has on society. Being part of the system makes you complicit, so you must remain cognizant of how your work affects the world. Learning to think ethically in this class made me realize that individual decisions carry far greater consequences than most people acknowledge. It's easy to be swayed by material wealth and career advancement, as I'm no exception, but before being blinded by those incentives, we must step back and question whether what we're contributing to is worth the personal gain.

## To the Future
The lessons from ICS 314 extend far beyond technical proficiency. While I've gained practical skills in web development and software engineering principles, the course's most valuable takeaway has been a change in perspective. I now approach problems with an engineer's mindset, hold myself to professional standards of code quality, and recognize my ethical responsibility as someone who will shape technology's role in society. These aren't just academic concepts to be learned and forgotten; they're the foundation of what it means to be a thoughtful, conscientious engineer. As I move forward in my career, I will carry these principles with me, ensuring that the work I do is not only well thought out but also responsible and worthy of the trust society places in those who build the digital world.
