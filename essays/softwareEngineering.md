## More Than Just Numbers

Coding, dealing with tons of numbers, and hours of debugging. If someone were to ask the average person what they think a software engineer does, this would probably be their answer. However, software engineering is more than just coding a project; it encompasses the process of creating something from scratch. Designing, collaborating, coding, testing, and maintaining software are all equally important parts of a software engineer's jobâ€” not just dealing with numbers and code. 


## A Software Engineer's Skills

This combination of collaboration, problem-solving, and technical skill is why I find software engineering so intriguing. Not only do you need the knowledge of how data structures and algorithms work, but you also need the creativity and persistence of problem-solving. On top of that, in order to effectively work with your team or fulfill a client's needs, one also needs proper communication skills to establish good working relationships and make sure everyone does their share of the work. While you can boil down the work of a software engineer to a circle of designing, creating, and maintaining, the workflow is still varied, as every step of the creation process means using a different skillset. This is part of the reason why I have so much passion for software engineering, as it combines such a varied skillset in order to properly do your job.

## The Future
I hope to further develop my knowledge of coding languages and frameworks so that I can create even more advanced and intricate software. I also hope to further develop collaboration skills, as well as learn what is used to maintain and further develop software. As technology moves forward at a blinding speed, software engineers have to constantly adjust to keep up. I want to be someone who can adapt to new technology, and in the future, create software that will actually make a difference.
