# Consistency in Code
Regulations and standards are something that is by no means foreign to me. Standards exist everywhere and are made to keep order, ensure quality, and maintain safety. Having worked at Baskin-Robbins for 3 years, I am well familiar with safety standards in the food industry; things like proper food handling and sanitization, as well as regulations and conduct for chains to ensure that each location is providing a similar experience. However, in terms of coding, using ESLint for the first time and having strict coding standards made me realize just how important consistency and regulations are, not just in the workplace, but in areas and professions like coding as well. 

# A Rough Start
At first, using ESLint with its strict coding standards was a big pain. Being used to coding on my own, there were a lot of things that I had to get used to that I wasn’t doing before. Things like having to add an extra line at the end of a file, making sure there are spaces in between parentheses, utilizing only one quotation instead of two, and making sure that variables I don’t reassign are initialized with const; all of these were things that I had to keep in mind when coding. It was especially painful when trying to solve a WOD in a timed environment, and having to worry about coding standards on top of solving the problem. 

# Standards in General
However, after practicing more with ESLint, I gradually got used to all of these extra steps. And after I got used to it, I now realize why standards are so important, even in coding. Having standards with coding helps prevent you from making errors in the future, and also makes your code easier to read for other people. In any situation where other people are reviewing or using a product that you’ve made, you want to ensure that the product is consistent with everything else. In the food industry, that means ensuring your food product always looks and is prepared consistently for safety. For coding, that’s making sure that your code is always typed in the same way for readability and for minimizing errors and bugs. Both of these ensure that others have no problems receiving your product, and in the long run, help build good practices for the future.
