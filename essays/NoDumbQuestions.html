## No Dumb Questions
“There’s no such thing as dumb question,” is a saying that’s been said countless times. And to a certain extent, it is true; it’s certainly better to ask a question than to sit in confusion. However, there is a clear distinction between a simple question and a good, well thought out one. A well thought out question allows others to identify what exactly to help with, and even allows for a better understanding— even if one may not be able to find a clear answer. 

## Questions For Software Engineers
Asking good questions is especially important for software developers and engineers. Dealing with complex code means running into countless errors and bugs, and in times of confusion and frustration, one has no choice but to get help and ask questions. However, before immediately going to stack overflow, doing your best to solve the problem on your own is more important. Being thorough and doing your own research to solve the problem before going out to ask help solves multiple problems: the first being that it eliminates careless mistakes. Things like syntax errors can be easily solved by looking carefully at your code, looking up the manual, or looking it up on google. The second is that it solves the problem of not knowing enough background. Sometimes problems are simply a matter of not knowing enough about your issue, and being overwhelmed with too much information. Doing your research before asking for help allows you to fill gaps in knowledge and gain a better context of the problem. 

## What Constitutes a Good Question?
Asking good questions is a combination of both doing research beforehand, but also, more importantly, being specific about what you need help with. Once you have a proper background knowledge of your problem, when asking a question you can then give proper context like the software version you’re using, specific language you’re in, the outcome that you wanted, and the outcome that you came out with. In doing so, you let others know that you’re serious about your topic, and eliminates a lot of other unknown factors that could be causing your issue. Especially for software engineers, because there are so many factors that could cause an issue, asking good, detailed questions allows people to precisely pinpoint the area to fix/ solve your problem.


Here’s an example of good question: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59638242/aws-dms-microsecond-precision-for-cdc-on-mysql-as-source-endpoint


This person’s question is clear about the software, context, and goal of their code. The user then gives further detail to their situation and gives a sample of their code. They then clearly establish what they want accomplished, describe the unwanted outcome that he comes to, and then re-establishes how it’s different from the desired outcome. 


This is a great example of a good question, and is supported by the positive responses. Because this user asked a good question that gave proper details, they got multiple detailed responses that explain clearly what went wrong and possible solutions. 

## Bad Questions
On the other hand, here is an example of a bad question:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79760329/do-i-use-the-it-wrong-the-concept-behind-notification-with-websockets


This person has a very unclear question; based on the title, it is very unclear as to what the user wants to accomplish. Moving on to the description, the grammar is terrible and it is still unclear as to what the user has trouble with and what he wants help with. On top of that, at the end, he asks if his code is ‘wrong’ and asks others what they would change without specifying his goal. 


While it’s clear that this person’s native language isn’t English (based on the code comments) there are multiple ways the user could have gone about asking the question. Things like clarifying that their native language isn’t English, or using a translator online could have solved this issue.

## Good Questions as a Skill
Learning about what constitutes a good and bad question made me learn a lot more about not only software engineering, but really how to tackle problem solving in general. While asking good questions is especially important for software engineers, this strategy can be applied anywhere in life, as getting proper context to your problem, trying your best to search and solve it yourself, then being as specific as possible to what outcome you want helps everyone involved in trying to resolve your issue. Learning to ask better questions doesn’t just make you a better engineer—it makes you a clearer thinker and communicator in every aspect of life.
